# 1. Introduction

<!-- 
    Changed this because them wanting to learn programming 
    isn't really a hypothetical at this point - they've picked up the book, 
    so the interest is already there.
-->
Hello, hello! So, you want to learn programming.
Whether that's because you want to bring an idea to life,
or find computing fascinating, or just think it'll be fun,
everyone has their own reason for learning how to code.
I'd like show you how to learn programming in a way that's both
practical and enjoyable.

<!-- The full stop felt a little off to me, idk -->
First off, what actually is programming?
Put simply, it's a way of telling a computer what you want it to do - 
generally in a very explicit, clear-cut way.

Computers are really good at taking some input, running some
manipulations or calculations on it, and giving back some output.
Both the input and the output are *data*.

What might our data be for input?:
- A text document
- A digital photo
- An MP3
- A spreadsheet of numbers

What calculations would we perform on those?:
- Spellchecking on the text
- Applying a filter to the photo
- Boosting the bass of the MP3
- Calculating tax information on the spreadsheet

We're getting ahead of ourselves, though.
When you really get down to it, some of the above gets pretty technical.
Let's start with something simple: letters.

Why letters? Well...
- Letters form words
- Words form sentences
- Sentences form paragraphs
- Paragraphs form chapters
- Chapters form books
- Books form libraries

Starting from something very small, you can build pieces together to form something huge.
In much the same way, all complex pieces of data and all complex operations are
fundamentally built from much smaller pieces gradually combined together.

In this book, we'll be using the Clojure programming language, which is extremely good
at composing lots of little components into relatively-easy-to-understand big systems.
